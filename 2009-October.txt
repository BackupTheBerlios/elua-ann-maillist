Hi,

After quite a bit of time, we have a new official release (0.6). Please find
the changes below:

* License changed to MIT
* Web page and documentation completely redesigned
* Documentation available offline
* Added documentation in portuguese
* Added support for AVR32 CPUs
* Added support for STM32 Cortex-M3 CPUs
* Added ADC module with support for moving average filters
* Added support for multiple toolchains
* Added an ls (or dir) shell command
* Added new examples: pong, tetrives, spaceship (games), logo (graphics),
adcpoll, adcscope (ADC operations)
* Added the LTR (Lua Tiny RAM) patch
* ROM FS content can be specified per board now
* API semantic revisions (old code might not be compatible)

We made this new release public on the same day the Lua workshop started
(and eLua was presented as part of the workshop), so we're naturally very
excited about this :) Thank you for all your support.
You can find all the project documentation at http://www.eluaproject.net

Best regards,
Bogdan and Dado
