Hi,

eLua version 0.5 is released! Here's the changelog:

* Added support for STR7 CPUs from ST
* Added TCP/IP support using the uIP stack
* Added support for console and shell over TCP/IP instead of serial link
* Added the "net" module (eLua's interface to TCP/IP functions)
* Added the "cpu" module (eLua's interface to the target CPU)
* New samples: morse.lua (Morse code encoder), lhttpd.lua (Lua scripting
HTTP server)
* Added support for cross-compiling Lua code (compile on PC, run on target)
* XMODEM can now receive Lua bytecode in addition to Lua source code
* The XMODEM buffer is now dynamic (grows as needed) instead of fixed size
* Project documentation updated

For more details, visit the project webpage at http://elua.berlios.de.

Best,
Bogdan
