Subject: [Elua-ann] [ANN] eLua v0.8 released
Message-ID: <AANLkTikHzpXxeGSxFWmmnu-m3SCyDDO=VnbFv6g_7CSA@mail.gmail.com>

We are proud to annunce the release of eLua v0.8

eLua is an effort to expand the presence of the Lua programming
language in the embedded world, especially on microcontroller-based
platforms. It is meant to be a complete MCU development environment.
It currently runs on a number of ARM variants (including Cortex-M3),
AVR32 (and i386 as a proof of concept).

The main changes from v0.7 are:
  * Added the RFS (Remote File System), a new file system which allows sharing
    a directory on the PC with the eLua board.
  * Added a serial multiplexer which allows using more virtual serial
ports over a single
    physical UART connection.
  * Added Lua and C interrupt handlers support.
  * Added linenoise support (eLua and Lua shell command line history
and navigation)
  * Added generic I2C support and docs
  * Added hardware flow control and runtime configurable buffers for UARTs.
  * Added support for new boards: mbed, EVK-1101, Mizar32, EK-LM3S1968
  * Added SPI and SD/MMC support for EVK1100 and EVK1101 (AVR32)
  * Added I2C support for STR-E912 (STR912)
  * Added support for require() and autorun from SD/MMC
  * Added external memory support for STR912
  * Added long filename support for SD/MMC
  * Added version() function to elua module
  * Added RTC (real time clock) platform specific support for str9
  * Added support for AsciiDoc in the doc builder
  * Tutorials and new projects added to the eLua User Labs wiki
  * Demo files were moved out of the distro to
http://wiki.eluaproject.net/Projects
  * Added a 'media' page with eLua related media on the project site

The main eLua resources are:
  * Main site:         http://www.eluaproject.net
  * eLua wiki:        http://wiki.eluaproject.net
  * Mail list:           https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/elua-dev
  * Web builder:   http://builder.eluaproject.net
  * Issue tracker:  http://tracker.eluaproject.net
  * Other:             http://www.eluaproject.net/en_comunity.html

Enjoy eLua!
