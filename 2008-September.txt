Subject: [Elua-ann] eLua 0.4.1 released
Message-ID: <81fbe47d0809101228t25e1f201s2b7603a9b1173096@mail.gmail.com>

Changelog:

* Minor release, its main purpose is to keep in sync with Lua and
integrate the latest official Lua distribution (5.1.4)
* Changed the file system structure; now you can build both Lua
versions (floating point and int only) from the same directory
* Made the math library configurable using the existent 'platform
libraries' mechanism
* The "os" and "package" modules are no longer loaded by Lua, since
they can't be used anyway. Because of this, the code size of eLua was
reduced.
* Project documentation updated
